# Student Performance Analysis and Prediction Dashboard

An interactive data mining dashboard developed to analyze student academic performance, identify behavioral patterns, explain machine learning predictions, and support data-driven educational decision making.

---

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a final project for the Data Mining course. The objective is to explore the factors that influence student performance and transform analytical findings into an interactive dashboard that is easy to understand and use.

The system integrates supervised learning, unsupervised learning, explainable AI, and predictive analytics within a single web application built using Streamlit.

## Dataset

The project uses the Student Performance Factors dataset containing 6,607 student records and 20 variables related to academic behavior, personal characteristics, family background, and educational environment.

Examples of variables include:

* Hours Studied
* Attendance
* Previous Scores
* Motivation Level
* Family Income
* Parental Involvement
* Internet Access
* Access to Resources
* Teacher Quality
* Extracurricular Activities

Target variable:

* Student Performance Category (Low, Medium, High)

## Project Modules

### Dataset Overview

Provides a comprehensive exploration of the dataset, including:

* Dataset preview
* Feature schema
* Descriptive statistics
* Correlation analysis
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

### Classification Analysis

Three machine learning models were developed and evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

Evaluation metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix

XGBoost achieved the best overall performance with an accuracy of 87.59%.

### Clustering Analysis

K-Means Clustering was applied to identify student behavioral segments.

Techniques used:

* Elbow Method
* Silhouette Score
* Cluster Profiling
* PCA Visualization

The analysis revealed five distinct student groups with different academic and behavioral characteristics.

### Explainable AI

SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) was used to improve model interpretability.

Features include:

* Global feature importance
* SHAP summary visualization
* Local prediction explanation

This module helps explain why a prediction is made and which factors contribute most to student performance.

### Prediction System

An interactive prediction page allows users to enter student information and generate real-time predictions.

Outputs include:

* Predicted performance category
* Prediction confidence
* Personalized recommendations
